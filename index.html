		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Our idea was to create a card who can be the best friend of every student. We know that inflation is rampant in France, and that it is particularly difficult to get by as a student in 2023. That's why EasyStudy offers students access to a network of food shops and other local businesses 




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>It's only 5€ for a year to adhere to the EasyStudy program. We will also propose a "premium" program which will cost about 9€ a year with obviously more reductions. This card is profitable because once the programme is chosen, it gives access to a whole range of discounts
